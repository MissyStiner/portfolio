# Missy Stiner's Portfolio

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Project Description
Using HTML and CSS, this portfolio is a sample of my work. My name, photo, small bio, work samples, and contact info are all included in a responsive format. The navigation menu links to the corresponding sections, and the work samples link to the corresponding deployed applications.
